# Mock Pages Repo


## What? 

Essentially a site to practise my CSS and HTML. I find CSS a pain, and want to understand it better. 
One exercise I did a year ago was to build a mock google homepage, using just HTMl and CSS (without the functionality).
I found this really useful to help understand CSS. So, this project is just a collection of my mock pages. 

One thing I may do in the future is go back and refactor the pages, to use the minimal amount of CSS possible. 
Another may be to make multiple examples of the same one with different techniques. 

But for now, I'm just going to copy some pages and put them here! 

## How to use

Just clone the repo, open a file in your browser and have a look! 

## Tech
